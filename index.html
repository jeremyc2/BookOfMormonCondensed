<div class="colors" id="studyQuestions">Where you start and stop.</br>Which passages are related.</br>How different ideas are grouped together.</div>
<div class="colors" id="revision">The Book of Mormon has been revised 7 times.</br>They fixed spelling and grammar.</br> But also added footnotes, chapter headings,</br>summaries, maps, illustrations, and guides.
<blockquote>"The first edition of the Book of Mormon had consisted of large, unnumbered chapters... In subsequent editions, some of these large paragraphs were divided and verse numbers were assigned to the paragraphs... In 1879, Elder Orson Pratt divided the Book of Mormon into small chapters and verses for easier reference. His numbering system became the standard for all later Latter-day Saint editions."</blockquote></div>
