Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise: Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit; And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us outâ€”Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee.
