And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of menâ€”Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.
